# Technical Questions 

 1) How long did you spend on the coding test below? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
    
    I spent around 20 hours. I took an extra time in order to implement a Single Page App with ReactJS, and provide a test suite with a coverage of 100%. 
    With additional time, I would have worked on other bonus points as: 
    - using VueJS instead of ReactJS as a Single Page App
    - host the app in AWS Lambda using Zappa or AWS ECS using AWS Fargate
